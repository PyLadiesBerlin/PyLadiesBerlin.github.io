Meetups
~~~~~~~

We have monthly meetups with talks and workshop on various python related and development in general and data topics.

You can find and join upcoming events on our `Meetup group <https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Berlin/>`__.

We do have varying levels in different meetups from novice to expert in specific topics. We always try to
include a "Non-coding superpower" 10 mins talk in the beginning. Because we belife (tech) life is much more than coding!
