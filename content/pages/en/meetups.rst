Meetups
~~~~~~~

In our monthly Meetup you can look forward to workshops and talks on various
Python topics, e.g. from the field of software development or data science.

In addition, we cover basic topics in our setup events that will make your
start with programming with Python easier.

You can find and join upcoming events on our `Meetup group
<https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Berlin/>`__.

We do have varying levels in different meetups from novice to expert in
specific topics. We often start our events with a 10 minute "Non-coding
superpower" talk because we believe (tech) life is much more than coding!

Call for speakers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We always welcome new interesting topics that you want to share with the Python
community ranging from a short 10min presentation of a specific framework to an
all-day workshop or a presentation of your very own Python project.

Reach out to us via `Email </contact.html>`_ or `Slack
<https://slackin.pyladies.com>`__.
