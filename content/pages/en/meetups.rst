Meetups
~~~~~~~

We have monthly meetups with talks and workshop on various python related and development in general and data topics.

You can find and join upcoming events on our `Meetup group <https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Berlin/>`_.

We do have varying levels in different meetups from novice to expert in specific topics. We always try to
include a "Non-coding superpower" 10 mins talk as tech life and life is much more than coding!

Speak in our meetup

We love to hear what you have to share with the community, from beginners topic to a project you worked on
or a hands on session or a non-coding superpower!
