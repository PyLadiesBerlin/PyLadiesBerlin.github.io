PyLadies Berlin is a chapter of the international PyLadies community, a group of girls and women coding in this lovely city. We are eager to develop and advance our knowlegde in the world of programming and you are invited to learn with us!

The global `PyLadies <https://pyladies.com/>`__ mentorship group has a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community with the mission to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

As a group of women developers who love the Python programming language. We write code by day or night. Some of us hack on Python projects on the side, while others work full-time on Python development. But it doesn't matter. We all just like writing Python code, and that's what brings us together.
