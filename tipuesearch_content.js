I work as a software developer/system engineer and like python most. I am able to write html/css/js but it's defenitely not my favorite. Then I am also able to write php code. Ehm, even if I don't like it very much, it's still usefull here and there. Trying to get warm with golang (dislike absence of exceptions) and hater of ruby/perl. NodeJS is cool as well. Bash is very useful but ugly as hell. As a sysadmin I manage debian servers and I have a strong aversion against windows. I don't like OSX either but still, it's less of a pain than windows. Also on my private machines, i prefer Ubuntu. Spare time Then in my spare time, i used to climb alot. But nowadays, I am a proud father of a great little girl as my main activity and since I gained some (alot of) weight in the past few years, I probably would'nt climb that much anyway. Still, we are in the mountains quite alot, hiking, skiing or just relaxing. Then I love to sail in strong (from my point of view, might not be that strong for others) winds. Just love getting wet in my small Byte CII from Nautivela. My sailing sessions are around 2 or maybe 3 hours, which is equal to 400 situps usually ;-) My skills are probably still on the low side but nevertheless I have a hell of fun doing it.","tags":"en","url":"https://pyladiesberlin.github.io/website/pages/about.html","loc":"https://pyladiesberlin.github.io/website/pages/about.html"},{"title":"Jobs","text":"Are you looking for a python related job?
