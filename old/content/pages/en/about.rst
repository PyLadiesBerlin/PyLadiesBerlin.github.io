About PyLadies Berlin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyLadies is an international mentorship group for marginalized genders, such as but not limited to non-binary people, trans people, and women in tech, with a focus on helping our community become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. All skill levels are welcome!

Gender Policy
-------------

We believe knowledge is for everyone. At the same time, our events primarily aim to empower women and gender minorities in the tech community. As a result, if you donâ€™t identify as part of either one of these, we request you to be aware of this situation and make your presence discrete, e.g., by coming with a woman or a person from a gender minority to ensure gender balance, and consider that you are not heard more or taking more space than others in discussions and question sections


Here's how you can join:
-------------------------

* Join our `Meetup <https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/PyLadies-Berlin/>`__ events as participant or mentor.
* Join the PyLadies `Slack <https://slackin.pyladies.com>`__ workspace.
* Ask questions!
