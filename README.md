## Contributing
PyLadies Berlin organization is a small team of volunteers, so we're always happy to have new contributors (:

Please follow this guidelines when contributing to our website development:

1. Pick an issue
2. Check if no one else is working on it, then assign it to yourself
3. Create a feature branch for your changes, name it by adding the issue number in the beginning and a short title - e.g. `1_basic_website_structure`
4. If you're not sure about something, ask about it on the issue's comments - that way we keep it documented
5. Open a Pull Request from your branch into the `deployment` branch
    - Add a short description of what you did and why you chose to do it that way
    - If there were visual changes, add before and after screenshots
6. Be patient and someone will check your contribution â™¡

We expect contributors to abide to this [code of conduct](https://github.com/PyLadiesBerlin/website/blob/development/code_of_conduct.md).
