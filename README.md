# 👩‍💻 Pyladies Berlin Chapter 🐍

This is the source code for the https://pyladiesberlin.github.io/website/ website.

PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings. PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!

Pyladies Berlin are regularly meeting once per month, every third Tuesday of the month. There is usually a talk and a hands on session over a python topic. Anyone is welcome to propose topics that wishes to learn and give a talk. For more checkout our meetup page https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Berlin/
