# PyLadies Berlin Website

The website is developed using the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework,
with the [Stone Astro Theme](https://github.com/withastro/astro) as base,
but modified to express better our branding, colors, and initiative.


## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Astro, HTML and CSS.
- Text editor (We recommend Visual Studio Code)
- Node.js 18 or higher.

### Install dependencies

Navigate to your project folder and install its dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

### Start

Once the installation is done, you can now run your app:

```
pnpm run dev
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Build

```
[npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `./dist/` folder.
