PyLadies is an international mentorship group for marginalized genders, such as
but not limited to non-binary people, trans people, and women in tech, with
a focus on helping our community become active participants and leaders in the
Python open-source community. All skill levels are welcome!

Founded in 2011 during PyCon PyLadies was a response to the lack of
representation and diversity within the Python community.

Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community
through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings. To
learn more about the global community, visit the PyLadies website.

We expect all participants in our events and community to abide by this [code of
conduct](https://pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct).
